I've cleared out this repository initially and left it alone for quite some time.

I was able to recently add a new file by signing into a browser and accessing my github account via web browser.

I'll begin this series with an introduction to the scope of the material and name the selections we'll be going over

hello world is a reference to a very special concept when you begin learning programming theory and coding and scpriting for the web or for any software application 
for any computer system

its important when we talk about programming to identify computers and their purpose so we understand that this term may apply to systems without user interfaces

the foundation of our computing power as the human species is that we utilize electricity as a resource
we've created power grid networks to light up cities worldwide

when we talk about computer programming we refer to any system to be implemented for one of these applications 
and to adopt and utilize the established business standards adhering to lexicographic and syntactical reference guides 
for different scopes and different platforms or applications
the computer as we've come to understand and apply it have four 
to five fundamental utilities depending on how you classify them: to create copy delete save and transfer information

embedded computers are becoming more prevalent with form factor scaling and advances in computing technologies
utilizing the radio technologies we have established communications networks specifically for transmitting images video and audio as well as text


so you'll encounter computer controllers in traffic lights, media entertainment controllers, elevators, vehicles, point of sale systems, as well as mobile cellular phones

the term hello world is a pop culture reference to the capitalist idea of the internet

when you create a text message for a user via a computer terminal and send it to the network for discovery by others you would feel an instant publishers gratification
the creators of the internet have monetized and sensationalized the access of information

the most popular hello world programs are the first syntactical guides to internet markup programming and scripting languages

we call virtually every first lesson in a web programming language tutorial that allows any sort of text output a hello world program

when you need to include specific operability features and attributes into your system you need to find a system design reference to help you design a functional model for your own project


so when we write simple scripting codes to display text messages on a network system all of our professional standards have creepy stylistic references 
that seem quizzically irrelevant except to credit the initial publisher

probably because they've just utilized a short hello world program to create their message online

and we'll be talking a little more about intellectual property in the series as well

most likely in a new file

hello world
